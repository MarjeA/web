                <h2>Gila Monster</h2>
                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>
                    The Gila monster (pronounced HEE-luh) is a small, striking lizard with black scales and an array of orange
                    stripes and spots.<br>Along with their close cousins, the beaded lizards, Gila monsters belong to
                    one of the only families of venomous lizards on Earth.<br>
                    Gila monsters appear pebbly in appearance due to a living coat of armor.
                    Osteoderms, or tiny chips of bone embedded within the skin, give the lizards a degree of protection against predators,
                    such as coyotes and hawks.

            <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
                Favourite Gila Monster foods include bird, tortoise, and snake eggs, as well as newborn bunnies and ground squirrels.
                Sometimes, the lizards will even climb tall cacti in search of bird nests and the tasty treats they contain.<br>
                In between feedings, which can be extremely infrequent, Gila monsters survive on fat stored inside their tails.<br>
                In fact, when evaluating Gila monster fitness, scientists actually dunk the lizard's tail in a cylinder
                of water to see how much liquid is displaced. The more water, the bigger the tail, and the healthier the Gila monster.

            <h3>Breeding behaviours</h3>
            <p>
                Between April and June, male Gila monsters compete in wrestling matches that can go on for hours.
                After the loser skulks away, the winner mates with the female. In late July, she finds a good nest where she lays
                four to eight eggs, leaves, and never looks back.<br>Females lay two to 12 leathery eggs that spend the winter below
                ground and hatch the next spring after 120 to 150 days.
                Hatchlings are about 6 inches (15 centimeters) long and are miniature replicas of their parents. Hatchlings are on their own immediately.

            <p>
                Gila monsters spend more than 90 percent of their lives below ground, which makes them difficult for scientists to research.
                However, some radiotracking work has revealed that the animals will, on occasion,
                travel more than a mile at a time in search of food or possibly mates.<br>
                Gila monster venom is wicked up from glands on the lower jaw by tiny grooves on each tooth.
                This means that to really envenomate their victims, the Gila monster actually has to clamp down and then chew.<br>
                Interestingly, Gila monsters appear to use their venom almost exclusively for defensive purposes.
                This is because their favorite foods are bird, tortoise, and snake eggs.
