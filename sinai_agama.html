                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>
                    Agama lizards are often grey or brown, but they can display various color combinations. They are sometimes called rainbow lizards
                    because dominant males change their color to show off and attract females.<br>Their bodies often turn blue, and their heads turn red
                    or yellow when males want to assert their dominance. The subordinate males and females have olive-green heads.<br>
                    Male and female agama lizards have a white underbelly and a light-colored stripe down the middle of their tail.
                    They also have dark patches of skin on either side of the stripe.<br> These lizards have external ear openings and eyelids,
                    as well as incisors and cheek teeth.

            <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
                Agama lizards are insectivores, which means they eat bugs and insects. Termites, beetles, grasshoppers, and ants are part of their
                diet in the wild. Agama lizards also occasionally eat small mammals, other reptiles, and local vegetation,
                so captive agama lizards should eat superworms, mealworms, or crickets.

            <h3>Breeding behaviours</h3>
            <p>
                Agama lizards breed all year round in captivity. However, reproduction occurs during the wet season in the wild.
                Females reach sexual maturity at 14 months old, and males reach sexual maturity at two years old.
                Females will dig a hole in sandy soil to lay their eggs, usually located in a sunny location. Females will then cover
                the hole in grass and vegetation.<br> Males work to gain attention from females during mating.
                Males bob their heads until they receive permission from females to mate. Males can also change color during mating.</p>

            <h3>Other behaviours and adaptations</h3>
            <p>
                Agama lizards are territorial and live in social groups in the wild. These groups usually consist of one dominant male, several females,
                and subordinate males. Subordinate males either have to usurp the head cock or move on to establish their own territory to mate.
                Agama lizards are active most of the day.<br> These lizards bask in the sun during the hottest hours of the day, usually between 10 am and 12 pm.
                Agama lizards are mostly docile creatures, but they will fight with other reptiles if they feel threatened or scared.
                Agama lizards are mild-mannered and docile. Males will defend their territory and bob their heads if they feel threatened,
                and they will also change color in an attempt to scare away potential predators. Males use their tails for protection
                and charge with their mouths open. Male Agamas raise and lower their heads to intimidate predators,
                which is something that you might notice your captive lizard do.<br>
                Agama lizards should be housed together in captivity. Experts recommend keeping at least three in a group, and groups should consist
                of one male and two females.<br> These lizards can be held by humans and will become tamer the more they are handled.
                Agama lizards are not prone to biting or harming handlers unless they feel threatened.
