                <h2>Leopard Gecko</h2>
                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>
                    Common leopard geckos are ground-dwelling lizards. They are larger than many other gecko species.<br>
                    Those found in the wild typically have more dark, dull, and drab colorations than those kept in
                    captivity as pets. Those in captivity generally have an assortment of skin colors and patterns.<br>
                    The skin of a Common leopard gecko is very durable, which provides protection
                    from the rough sand and rocky hills terrain of their dry environment.<br> Their dorsal side is
                    covered with small bumps, which gives a rough texture and appearance while their ventral side
                    is thin, transparent, and smooth.<br> Like all reptiles, Common leopard geckos shed their skin.
                    Adults shed an average of once a month, while juveniles will sometimes shed twice as much.

            <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
                Life in arid desert environments is unforgiving, and does not allow for pickiness.
                These reptiles are generalists, and will feed on anything small enough to fit in their mouths (that will not kill them of course.)
                This translates to crickets, worms, roaches, moths, spiders, and a variety of other insects and invertebrates.
                Extra fat is stored in the tail so that they can survive periods of dormancy and times when food is scarce.

            <h3>Breeding behaviours</h3>
            <p>
                Common leopard geckos breed typically in the summer. Females can lay about 6 to 8 clutches, which consists of 2 eggs
                in each clutch. They will normally lay 2 eggs approximately 21 to 28 days after mating.
                The sex of the hatchlings is determined based on the temperature at which the eggs are incubated.
                Females are hatched if the temperatures are between 26-29 °C, while males can be produced from incubation
                temperatures of 31-33 °C.

                Although popular as pets, very little information is known about leopard geckos in their natural habitats.
                At present, their exact number is still unknown. Interestingly, their unique spots
                function for camouflage; thus making them almost invisible to their predators.<br>
                Common leopard geckos have many predators such as snakes, foxes, and other large reptiles.
                Their keen sense of hearing and sight help them escape from them during the night.<br> Along with their exceptional
                sight and hearing abilities, their skin helps camouflage themselves from their predators.
                Their sense of taste and smell also helps them with survival.<br>They also stay in underground holes and burrows
                during the daytime, not only to avoid the heat but to also avoid the risk of getting eaten.
                Common leopard geckos are not very vocal but when stressed they will produce barks and squeaks.
