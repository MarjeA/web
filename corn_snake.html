                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>
                    Corn snakes, sometimes called red rat snakes, are slender, orange or brownish-yellow snakes
                    with a pattern of large, red blotches outlined in black down their backs.<br>
                    These snakes exhibit considerable variations in color and pattern, depending on their age
                    and geographic range. Young hatchlings also lack the brighter coloration seen in adults.<br>
                    Along their bellies are distinctive rows of alternating black and white marks,
                    which resemble a checkerboard pattern.<br> The name corn snake may have originated from the similarity
                    of these markings to the checkered pattern of kernels of maize or Indian corn.

                These constrictors bite their prey to get a firm grip, then quickly coil themselves around their meal,
                squeezing tightly until the prey is subdued. Finally, they swallow their food whole, usually headfirst.<br>
                These snakes typically feed every few days. Young hatchlings eat lizards and tree frogs,
                while adults feed on larger prey, such as mice, rats, birds and bats.<br>
                Corn snakes have also been observed swallowing small prey alive

            <h3>Breeding behaviours</h3>
            <p>
                Corn snakes are oviparous. Breeding season takes place in March to May. In late May to July the female snakes
                lay a clutch of 10-30 eggs in rotting stumps, piles of decaying vegetation or other similar locations
                with sufficient heat and humidity to incubate the eggs. The female abandons the eggs and does not return to them.<br>
                The eggs are oblong with leathery, flexible shells. About 10 weeks after laying,
                the snakelets use a specialized scale called an egg tooth to slice slits in the eggshell, from which they emerge.

                Corn snakes are solitary creatures. They are active at night and spend most of their daytime underground
                in burrows or hiding under logs, rocks, or loose bark. Typically, these snakes remain on the ground until
                the age of four months but can ascend trees, cliffs, and other elevated surfaces.<br>
                In colder regions, Corn snakes brumate during winter. However, in the more temperate climate along
                the coast, they shelter in rock crevices and logs during cold weather;
                they also can find shelter in small, closed spaces, such as under a house,
                and come out on warm days to soak up the heat of the sun.<br>
                During cold weather, snakes are less active, so hunt less.<br> Corn snakes have a very sharp sense of smell
                which they use to hunt their prey. They usually eat every few days and hunt on the ground, climbing trees or in tunnels underground.
