                <h2>African Fat-Tailed Gecko</h2>
                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>
                    African fat-tailed geckos are 8-10in lizards with a long, stout body, stubby limbs, an oval head, pebbled skin,
                    and a plump, segmented tail.<br> Their coloring features alternating bands of medium and dark brown,
                    sometimes with dark spots and white markings, including a white stripe from head to tail.<br>
                    Although they are geckos, they are unique from most others in that they have eyelids and can not walk up walls.<br>
                    Male and females display sexual dimorphism (i.e. differentiating physical features between the sexes).
                    Males are typically larger than females and will have a thicker tail.<br>The African Fat-Tailed Gecko is one of only a few
                    species to have eyelids, which prevent dust from entering their eyes.<br>

            <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
                Their diet consists mainly of insects and other invertebrates they encounter during the night-time in the savannahs,
                including different types of worms, crickets and beetles. In captivity, they may only want to eat live prey,
                but other than that their diet is simple to fulfill. <br> When kept in captivity, African Fat-Tailed Geckos
                should be fed crickets and other types of larval insects like mealworms.<br>
                They will also require additional supplements such as vitamin D3 to help them adapt to a new environment.

            <h3>Breeding behaviours</h3>
            <p>
                Fat-tailed Geckos have a breeding season of around 5 months in length each year. <br>
                During this time, female geckos can lay up to five clutches of eggs, though many will lay fewer clutches in a year.
                In captivity the incubation period for these geckos depends on the temperatures at which the eggs are kept.
                Lower temperatures (80-85 degrees Fahrenheit) will result in a longer gestation period
                compared to higher temperatures (88-90 degrees Fahrenheit). <br>
                Once the gestation period is complete, geckos grow at equal rates (starting with a mass around 4 grams once they hatch)
                regardless of gender until they being to reach maturity around 8-11 months after hatching.

            <h3>Other behaviours and adaptations</h3>
            <p>
                In the wild, and in captivity, African Fat-Tailed Geckos are extremely docile, gentle and calm lizards,
                who spend their time sleeping, basking and occasionally hunting for insects during the night.<br>
                They are primarily nocturnal, entirely terrestrial, and will move out in search of food only after sundown.
                During daytime, they would usually spend lazy hours sleeping or hiding inside crevices or under barks. <br>
                In general, they move slowly, but when threatened, they will run away quickly, but only for a short distance.<br>
                They vocalise and communicate with other members by clicking their tongue on the roof of their mouth.<br>
                These reptiles are territorial, and not at all social. They prefer spending time alone, other than during mating.
