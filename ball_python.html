                <h2>Ball Python</h2>
                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>
                    Ball pythons are stocky, with a relatively small head. The scales are smooth and both sexes have anal spurs
                    on either side of the vent.<br> The color pattern is typically black or dark brown with light brown or gold sides
                    and dorsal blotches. The belly is white or cream that may include scattered black markings.<br>
                    However, those in the pet industries have, through selective breeding, developed many morphs
                    (genetic mutations) with altered colors and patterns.<br>
                    Breeders are continuously creating new designer morphs, and over 6,500 different morphs currently exist.

            <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
                Ball pythons are carnivores. In the wild, their diet consists mostly of small mammals,
                such as African soft-furred rats, shrews, gerbils, and striped mice and birds.<br>
                However, their prey is not limited to these animals, they will feed on any bird or mammal small enough to be swallowed.<br>
                Males are more arboreal than females and so eat more birds than mammals.<br>
                They use chemical and visual cues to hunt for their prey. Ball pythons sit and wait to ambush prey.<br>
                In captivity, they will accept common rats and mice, and some will eat chicks.

            <h3>Breeding behaviours</h3>
            <p>
                Ball pythons are polygynandrous (promiscuous) which means that both males and females mate with multiple partners.<br>
                They usually breed from mid-September through mid-November. Females lay 3 to 11 large,
                leathery eggs (4 to 6 are most common). Eggs are incubated by the female under the ground
                (via a shivering motion), and hatch after 55 to 60 days. <br> Parental care of the eggs ends once they hatch,
                and the female leaves the offspring to fend for themselves.

                Ball pythons exhibits a number of adaptations that have helped it survive and
                which set it apart from the other species. Some of these adaptations include its jaws, size,
                skin pattern, and method for killing prey.<br>
                Ball python attacks its prey by biting it quickly, and pulling it into its' grasp.
                Once entangled, the creature has little chance of survival, as the python carefully coils itself
                around the prey and begins to constrict it, or tighten itself.<br>
                This usually does not break any bones in the prey animal, but rather causes the animal to lose breath and eventually suffocate.
                Ball pythons are known for their defense strategy that involves coiling into a tight ball when threatened,
                with their head and neck tucked away in the middle. In this state, they can literally be rolled around.<br>
                Ball pythons are nocturnal, with males carrying out arboreal behavior at night
                and hiding in burrows during the day. They are most active at dawn and dusk in general,
                and they're more active during the wet season.<br>
                Ball pythons, like all other snakes, shed their skin periodically. This can occur as often as once every three or four weeks,
                or as rarely as once or twice per year, depending on the size, age, and health of the individual.<br>
                Possibly the coolest adaptation this species exhibits is its ability to unhinge its jaw and consume
                its prey completely whole. Its skin is also very stretchable, which allows it to compensate for consuming such large prey items.
