                <h2>Iguana</h2>
                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>
                    Iguanas come in a range of colors, from nearly yellow, to bright green, to grey.
                    Some have hints of red or orange on their spines, legs, and other appendages.<br>
                    Younger individuals tend to be a brighter shade of green, while older individuals fade into yellow, grey, or a mixture of both.<br>
                    Adults can be anywhere from 5-6 ft. long, and their tail contributes greatly to their length.
                    These lizards also have narrow spines running down the length of their back.

            <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
                Iguanas are herbivorous, meaning they eat plants; specifically, they are folivores, meaning they eat leaves.<br>
                In the wild, iguanas feed almost entirely on the leaves of trees and vines, plus some fruits and flowers.<br>
                As hindgut fermenters, iguanas have specific microbes (special bacteria and flagellate organisms)
                that normally inhabit their gastrointestinal tracts to ferment the high-fiber foods they ingest,
                so that nutrients in their food can be absorbed in their intestines and used by their bodies.

            <h3>Breeding behaviours</h3>
            <p>
                Iguanas tend to breed in the dry season, ensuring that young hatch in the wet season when food is more readily available.<br>
                Females lay their eggs about 65 days after mating (eggs take 59 to 84 days to develop before they are laid).
                Over the course of three days, females may up to 65 eggs. Eggs are deposited into nests,
                which are located 45 cm to more than a meter deep, and may be shared with other females if nesting areas are limited.<br>
                Incubation lasts from 90 to 120 days.

            <h3>Other behaviours and adaptations</h3>
            <p>
                Primarily herbivores, iguanas are active during the day, feeding on leaves, flowers, and fruit.
                They generally live near water and are excellent swimmers.<br>
                If threatened, they will leap from a branch, often from great heights, and escape with a splash
                to the water below.<br> They are also tough enough to land on solid ground from as high as 40 feet and survive.<br>
                Iguanas' stout build gives them a clumsy look, but they are fast and agile on land.
                They have strong jaws with razor-sharp teeth and sharp tails, which make up half their body length
                and can be used as whips to drive off predators.<br>
                They can also detach their tails if caught and will grow another without permanent damage.
