                <h2>Central Bearded Dragon</h2>
                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>
                    The Central bearded dragon is a species of lizard with a flattened body, entirely covered by specialized scales.
                    The dragons look rather stout and thorny with large and rounded eyes.<br>
                    The specialized scales form spiny projections, densely covering the flap of their skin. The dragons have orbital crests,
                    running from behind their eyes, covering the face and reaching the tip of the snout.<br>Strong legs are covered with pointed and shingled scales,
                    each leg having 5 clawed digits at the end. Males are larger than females though having more flattened body.<br>
                    When in danger, the guttural pouch of a male dragon becomes notably stronger and darker.
                    Color of the Central bearded dragons usually depends on temperature and locality.<br>
                    They are mainly grey with occasional shades of black, brown, fawn or orange.
                    The area around their eyes and at the side of the head is often yellow in color.

            <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
                The Central bearded dragon is an opportunistic omnivore who is not very choosy about food.
                Bearded dragons come from a habitat where food may be sparse, so they accept a wide variety of different foods.<br>
                These dragons feed upon small rodents, lizards, insects, spiders well as plants.
                Young, growing bearded dragons tend to be primarily carnivores and adults tend to be more herbivorous (vegetation eaters).<br>
                As a guideline, depending on its age, a bearded dragon's diet should be about 50% plant-based material
                and 50% animal-based (insect) material.

            <h3>Breeding behaviours</h3>
            <p>
                Like all dragon lizards, Bearded Dragons are egg-layers.
                In south-eastern New South Wales, females are gravid (with eggs) in mid-spring (around November).<br>On the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia,
                females lay their eggs in mid-spring. The clutch sizes ranges 11-30 eggs.<br>In captivity, individual females have laid up to four clutches in one
                "season" (15 October-17 June) at intervals as short as 13 days.

            <script>
                function myFunction(){
                    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Central Bearded Dragons can regrow their teeth"
                }
            </script>
            <p>
                The species basks to maintain preferred body temperature. When the animals body temperature rises to relatively high and presumably dangerous
                levels, they open their mouths to varying degrees,<br> presumably in order to cool the blood passing through the head by evaporative cooling
                from the moist membranes of the mouth.<br>
                Like other Bearded Dragons, this species is an adept climber, and can usually be found on tree stumps, tree branches, boulders and fence posts.
                From the elevated position the lizard will bask in the sunlight<br>and keep an eye out for potential predators, prey, rivals and mates.
                During extremely hot periods, individuals may remain perched above ground for long periods.<br>For example,
                on one occasion a male remained perched in the same tree 3 m above the ground for three weeks.
                When alarmed the lizard faces the intruder with mouth wide open and beard puffed out to make the jaw appear larger.<br>
                The dragon inhales air rapidly to expand the body, making the spiked sides of the animal appear rigid and the overall size
                seem greater to the aggressor.<br>
                The lizards can undergo rapid colour change. For example, one specimen changed from predominantly all yellow to almost
                completely black in no more than a few minutes.<br>Mature males often change the colour of their lower jaw (beard) from the normal
                colouration to black. When puffed up in a defensive pose, the beard then appears more striking.
